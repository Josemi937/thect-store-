# Tech Store

A modern demo e-commerce website built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, fully powered by Contentful CMS.  
This project is part of my personal learning journey to understand headless CMS, dynamic product rendering and real-world web development workflows.

- Responsive layout  
- Modal image viewer  
- Simple and clean project structure

## 🔧 How It Works

- All homepage content is fetched from the **Contentful `homePage`** content type.
- Product pages (e.g., Headphones & Laptops) are fetched from the **`product`** and **`product2`** content types.
- Products and sections can be edited directly in Contentful — no code changes required.

## 🧩 Future Improvements

- Add more product categories  
- Add a real shopping cart  
- Add user login / authentication  
- Migrate to a more scalable framework (Next.js or Astro)  
- Deploy online
